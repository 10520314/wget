FILES

  The source code is available via subversion at
  https://sourceforge.net/projects/ytd2/.
  The repository contains either the latest released sources or
  changes for the next upcoming release. There are no branches or
  tags for now.


INSTALL

  There is no need to install it. YTD2 consists of just one
  runnable file. Maybe there is an option of Java Web Start in the
  future. 

	
RUNNING

  runytd2.jar should be executable via Java Runtime Environment
  JRE 1.5 and later.

  running ytd2 via command shell:
  java -jar runytd2.jar 

  running ytd2 via file explorer:
  just click on the jar-file  (works if the file has execute file
  permissions (on *ix platform) and JRE is a registered application
  for jar-files)
	

TODO

  GUI option for proxy/resolution
  URls with playlists or other unusual things
  correct handling of directories for download (esp. on M$-Windows)
  entire GUI as drop target for mouse events
	
  maybe: Java Web Start, translated GUI (or no text at all)

  Any hints, suggestions, features, questions .. are welcome!

                bugfixes: proxy now works with/without protocol

    2010-12-17  fixing bugs regarding application shutdown

                initial version uploaded
    2010-12-01? development started
				
					
  I decided to not provide a single version number but rather
  a releasedate_time as version. A number does not provide any
  extra information but the date does. (IMHO)
  YTD2 is named after ytd (https://sourceforge.net/projects/ytd/)
  but the author never changed any bug reports nor answered
  e-mails or forum posts.
