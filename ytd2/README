USAGE

  YTD2 is for downloading videos as flv/mp4-files on your
  computer.
  The web-browser downloads webresources (e.g. binary data) to
  a temporary folder before displaying it. YTD2 does the
  same except You can choose where to save the files.
  YTD2 is meant for private non-commercial use only. 


FILES

  The source code is available via subversion at
  https://sourceforge.net/projects/ytd2/.
  The repository contains either the latest released sources or
  changes for the next upcoming release. There are no branches or
  tags for now.
  The jar-files/sources of the http-components can be downloaded at
  http://hc.apache.org/downloads.cgi


INSTALL

  There is no need to install it. YTD2 consists of just one
  runnable file. Maybe there is an option of Java Web Start in the
  future. 

	
RUNNING

  runytd2.jar should be executable via Java Runtime Environment
  JRE 1.5 and later.

  running ytd2 via command shell:
  java -jar runytd2.jar 

  running ytd2 via file explorer:
  just click on the jar-file  (works if the file has execute file
  permissions (on *ix platform) and JRE is a registered application
  for jar-files)
  
  
PROXY

  You can set the proxy either before running ytd2 or after start via
  input "proxy [http://]proxyhost:proxyport" or without http://
  
  example (on GNU/Linux) before start:
      knoedel@section60:~/workspace$ http_proxy=http://localhost:3128
      /*next command is not needed on windows*/
      knoedel@section60:~/workspace$ export http_proxy
      knoedel@section60:~/workspace$ java -jar runytd2.jar
  
  example after start - type in as URL:
      proxy http://localhost:3128
  
  localhost:3128 is just an example (of a local squid-cache proxy)


TODO
  
  GUI option for proxy
  correct handling of directories for download (esp. on M$-Windows)
	
  maybe: Java Web Start, translated GUI (or no text at all),
         video from other websites (imdb.com, video.web.de,..)

  Any hints, suggestions, features, questions .. are welcome!

  I decided not to provide a single version number but rather
  a releasedate_time. A number does not provide any extra
  information but the date does. (IMHO)
  YTD2 is named after ytd (https://sourceforge.net/projects/ytd/)
  but the author never changed any bug reports nor answered
  forum posts.
