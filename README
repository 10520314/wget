          ======================================

This is YTD2 clone of https://sourceforge.net/projects/ytd2/.

The main goal of this project is to provide stand alone library
for downloading videos from youtube.

The main project dose not go this way, so I deside to create clone
and make it possible.

Simple exmpale can be found in YTD2.java in the main function.
